```bash
pip install python-dotenv flask flask-sqlalchemy Flask-Migrate flask_validator psycopg2-binary
```

Then make a folder called src which will contain the project codes

```bash
mkdir src && cd $_
```

The Last step before starting with the code, create a requirements file using this command:

```bash
python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
